```
 JG.repeat(1, 100, {
     id: JG.index(),
     email() {
         return (
             _.snakeCase(this.name) +
             '@' +
             JG.company() +
             JG.domainZone()
         ).toLowerCase();
     },
     firstName: JG.firstName(),
     lastName: JG.lastName(),
     age: JG.integer(18, 70),
     address: `${JG.integer(1, 100)} ${JG.street()}, ${JG.city()}, ${JG.state()}`,
